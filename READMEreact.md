# Guessing Game

A game of guessing a number based on varying degrees of difficulty. The object of the game is to guess the correct number that was randomly generated by the game engine. The game indicates (using a message and color) how close/ or far your guess is from the actual generated number. Upon guessing the correct number, one is presented with the option to play again.

The game provides 3 difficulty level settings:
* Easy - 0 -> 10
* Medium - 0 -> 100
* Difficult - 0 -> 1000

The use of a single Game component that also uses a GuessEngine class to manage the game logic.

This project demonstrates:

* a typical React project layout structure
* babel setup and configuration
* webpack setup and configuration
* eslint setup and configuration
* SCSS setup and configuration

## Developed With

* [react layout structure] (https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33935506/34461376-955fe31a-ee30-11e7-87a2-7b719e14b7fd.png)

* [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) must have scss (css metalanguage) to expedite the reuse of variables

## Student

* **Brandi Taylor** - *Open source downloaded designed by Douglas Minnaar for the express use to help beginners learn how to complete a project with multiple open source development tools through deconstruction and then re-construction.*

## Initial Author

* **Douglas Minnaar** - *Initial work* - [drminnaar](https://github.com/drminnaar)

**Important Update** - *This file that came with this tutorial labeled package-lock.json ended up having so many vulnerabilities I was able to hack into my dropbox via my web browser when I was following a path.  My suspicions were confirmed when I committed the project into git hub.  It immediately flagged numerous parts of this one file as Critical Severity. It is currently 11/9/18 and I am going to attempt to get this up and running but I fear this will cause me to fail the semester because between work and familial obligations I have been struggling for time to get this far.



## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The following software is required to be installed on your system:

* Node 8.x
* Npm 3.x

Type the following commands in the terminal to verify your node and npm versions

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Install

Follow the following steps to get development environment running.

* Clone _'react-masterminds'_ repository from GitHub

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/10121416/react-project.git
  ```


* Install node modules

   ```bash
   cd react-masterminds
   npm install
   npm dedupe
   ```

### Build

* Build application

  This command will also run ESLint as part of build process.

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

* Build application and start watching for changes

  This command will also run ESLint as part of build process.

  ```bash
  npm run build:watch
  ```

### Run ESlint

* Lint project using ESLint

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

* Lint project using ESLint, and autofix

  ```bash
  npm run lint:fix
  ```

### Run

* Run start

  This will run the _'serve'_ npm task

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

* Run webpack dev server

  ```bash
  npm run serve:dev
  ```

* Alternatively run live-server (simple development http server with live reload capability)

  ```bash
  npm run serve
  ```
