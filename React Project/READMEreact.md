# Guessing Game

A game of guessing a number based on varying degrees of difficulty. The object of the game is to guess the correct number that was randomly generated by the game engine. The game indicates (using a message and color) how close/ or far your guess is from the actual generated number. Upon guessing the correct number, one is presented with the option to play again.

The game provides 3 difficulty level settings:
* Easy - 0 -> 10
* Medium - 0 -> 100
* Difficult - 0 -> 1000

The use of a single Game component that also uses a GuessEngine class to manage the game logic.

This project demonstrates:

* a typcial React project layout structure
* babel setup and configuration
* webpack setup and configuration
* eslint setup and configuration
* SCSS setup and configuration
